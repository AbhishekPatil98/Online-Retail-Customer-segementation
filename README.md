Indroduction:-
Every day, businesses around the world expand. They have access to a larger market and a vast consumer base thanks to technology. Customer segmentation is the process of grouping customers into several categories based on shared traits.


In this project, a multinational data set for an online retailer based in the UK will be used to identify key client categories.

The goal of this research is to determine the key consumer categories from a multinational data set that includes every transaction made by a UK-based, registered non-store internet retailer between December 1, 2010, and December 9, 2011. The company primarily offers one-of-a-kind gifts for every occasion. Wholesalers are among the company's most frequent clients.

Customer segmentation is essential.
Grouping clients according to their variances in behaviour, demographics, geography, etc., is helpful. Understanding various client groups can help with the following:

Market Research

client comprehension

optimum product positioning

revenue increase

Customer value is calculated using the Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) model.
In retail customer segmentation, where only customer transaction data is available, the RFM model is a very helpful tool. The three dimensions are referred to as RFM.

How recently did the customer make their purchase?

How frequently do they make purchases?

Financial Value: How much money do they have?

To provide clients a numerical value, these three characteristics can be combined. e.g. A high value customer is one who frequently transacts and has lately purchased high value products.

putting several clustering models into practise and validating

Conclusions:
Detailed analysis: The analysis of the online consumer segmentation dataset reveals that:

We discovered duplicate and missing values.

The majority of the purchases are made in the UK.

The most frequent shopping days are Thursday, Wednesday, and Tuesday.

The months of November, October, and December saw the most client purchases, while April, January, and February saw the fewest.

The majority of sales occur in the afternoon.

The clients have been divided into several clusters using a recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) analysis.

By using various clustering algorithms on our dataset, we discover that three clusters are the ideal number.

The company can concentrate on these several clusters and offer clients services from each sector in a unique fashion, which would be advantageous for both the customers and the company as a whole.
