Indroduction:-

Businesses all over the world are growing every day. With the help of technology, they have access to a wider market and hence, a large customer base. Customer segmentation refers to categorizing customers into different groups with similar characteristics.
This project aims to identify major customer segments on a transnational data set for a UK-based online retail.
