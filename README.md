# Indroduction:-

Businesses all throughout the world grow daily. Technology has given them access to a broader market and a large customer base. The technique of dividing a client base into several categories based on shared characteristics is known as customer segmentation.
In this project, a multinational data set for an online retailer based in the UK will be used to identify key client categories.

# Problem Description :
Using a global data collection that contains each transaction performed by a UK-based, registered non-store internet retailer between December 1, 2010, and December 9, 2011, your task in this project is to identify the important consumer segments.

# The need of customer segmentation:
Grouping clients according to their variances in behaviour, demographics, geography, etc., is helpful. Understanding various client groups can help with the following:
Target Marketing

Client understanding

Optimal product placement

Revenue growth

# Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) model to determine customer value:
The RFM model is quite useful model in retail customer segmentation where only the data of customer transaction is available. RFM stands for the three dimensions:

Recency – How recently did the customer purchase?

Frequency – How often do they purchase?

Monetary Value – How much do they spend?

To provide clients a numerical value, these three characteristics can be combined. e.g. A high value customer is one who frequently transacts and has lately purchased high value products.

# Approach taken
Data inspection

EDA

Data preparation

Create RFM model

Implementing various clustering Models and validating

# Conclusions:
Descriptive Analysis: The online customer segmentation dataset analysis reveals the following:

We discovered duplicate and missing values.

The majority of the purchases are made in the UK.

The most frequent shopping days are Thursday, Wednesday, and Tuesday.

The months of November, October, and December saw the most client purchases, while April, January, and February saw the fewest.

The majority of sales occur in the afternoon.

The clients have been divided into several clusters using a recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) analysis.

By using various clustering algorithms on our dataset, we discover that three clusters are the ideal number.

The company can concentrate on these several clusters and offer clients services from each sector in a unique fashion, which would be advantageous for both the customers and the company as a whole.
