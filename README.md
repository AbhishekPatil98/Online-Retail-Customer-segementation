# Indroduction:-

Every day, businesses around the world expand. They have access to a larger market and a vast consumer base thanks to technology. Customer segmentation is the process of grouping customers into several categories based on shared traits.

In this project, a multinational data set for an online retailer based in the UK will be used to identify key client categories.
